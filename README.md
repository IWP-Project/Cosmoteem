# COSMOTEEM

The repository for Cosmoteem i.e. Space-Forum-Website. This project was initially developed by 3 people as a part of their course project in Internet Web Programming and Development(IWP). It was decided to take this project out to a higher degree and professionalize it and also simultaeneously improving our skills in the domain of Web Dev. 

Purpose: The Website Idea came up when we had trouble as space enthusiasts and stargazers to find any good interactable online community based on astronomy especially to our geographic locations. Hence we came up with Cosmoteem. Cosmoteem expects to build an entire community around stargazing, astronomy and space related activities. A platform where people can communicate with each other via forums mainly to ask questions and answer questions and help each other out. This is the main purpose of the website.                                      
->However, there are many plans to improve the website's features. 
->The Website is still under Development.

As of now, the features include:
1. Forums
2. News Page - Space and related RSS news from reputable sources
3. Model Solar System Animation under Planetarium
4. Gallery of top selected astrophotography
5. Store

Working on:
1. Fixing Mobile Responsiveness - Short term
2. UI design - Long term
3. Realistic Controllable Simualtion of Solar System -> Milky way -> Universe
